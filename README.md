## Features
* **Basic Jet Movement:** Controls for forward thrust, pitch, yaw, and roll.
* **Speed Adjustment:** Ability to increase or decrease speed.
* **Realistic Physics:** Uses Unity's physics engine for a more realistic flying experience.
* **Modular Design:** Easily customizable and extendable for more complex behavior.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SimpleUnityJetControlSystem.git`
3. Open the project in Unity.
4. Attach the provided scripts to your jet GameObject.
5. Customize the settings in the Inspector as needed.

## Usage
* Use the arrow keys or `WASD` to control the jet's movement.
* Adjust the speed using the defined keys (normally defined keys are `Space` to increase, `Left Ctrl` to decrease).
* The jet responds to physics-based interactions, making it suitable for various game scenarios.

## Customization
Feel free to modify the scripts to better fit your project needs. You can:
* Adjust the jetâ€™s speed and handling characteristics.
* Integrate additional features such as weapons, HUD displays, or AI-controlled jets.
* Expand the system to support more complex environments and challenges.
